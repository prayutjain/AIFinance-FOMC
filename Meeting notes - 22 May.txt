fed / central bank speak - for macro investing purpose

change in tone - could be a great indicator



1) Analyse the speech directly, not just the text?
2) Use it as a predictive tool - to select sectors?
3) 


Data-
- Easiest to get: Fed minutes - maybe start with last 5 years - 
- Original verson: Discussion and then a Q/A


These are the KPI we want to focus on -- Unemployment, economy, financial stress, inflation

FOMC statement

Maybe add a score around it later
