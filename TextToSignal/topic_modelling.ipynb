       "      <td>BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Binya  App elbaum, the New York Times .  To what extent do \\r\\nyou regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted?  Was \\r\\nit a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you stand by your \\r\\nguidance that it will be appropriate ?  Do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down \\r\\nasset purchases by the end of this year?  \\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So to  answer the first part of your question, I think ther e’s \\r\\nno alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible , and that ’s \\r\\nwhat we tried to do.  As of June, we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions , \\r\\nand the C ommittee thought that was the time to begin talking ab out how the eventual wind- down \\r\\nof the program would take place and how it would be tied to the evolution of economic variables .  September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL \\r\\nPage 9 of 2 7 And, in particular, I talked about a proposed strategy that would take about a year for the total \\r\\nwind -down to take place and w hich, in turn, was also fully contingent on the ratification —so to \\r\\nspeak —of our outlook, which included continued improvements in the labor market .  So all of \\r\\nthat was very consistent with what we said when we began the program , that our goal was to \\r\\nachieve a substantial improvement in  the outlook for the labor market , and we needed to \\r\\ncommunicate how that was going to be put into practice .  Failing to communica te that \\r\\ninformation would have  risked creating a large divergence bet ween market expectations, public \\r\\nexpectations, and what the C ommittee intentions were , and that could have led to much more \\r\\nserious problems down the road.  So I think the communication was very important .   \\r\\nThe general framework —to answer the other part of your question, the general \\r\\nframework in which we ’re operating is still the same .  We have a three- part baseline projection , \\r\\nwhich involves increasing growth that ’s picking up over  time as fiscal drag is reduced, \\r\\ncontinuing gains in the labor market , and inflation moving back towards objective .  We are \\r\\nlooking to see —in the coming meetings, we ’ll be looking to see if the data confirm that basic \\r\\noutlook.  If it does, we ’ll take a first step at some point—possibly later this year —and then \\r\\ncontinue so long as  the data are consistent with that continued  progress .  And so that basic \\r\\nstructure is still in place . \\r\\nBut what I want to emphasize is really two things .  First, as I ’ve said, asset purchases are \\r\\nnot on a preset course, they are conditional on the data .  They’ve always been conditional on the \\r\\ndata.  And , secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal \\r\\ntool of monetary policy , it’s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide \\r\\nthe support necessary fo r our economy to recover and to provide jobs for our citizens.

       "      <td>JON HILSENRATH.  Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Just to follow up on \\r\\nBinya’s question, Mr. Chairman, you said that you could pull  back the purchases possibly later \\r\\nthis year .  You sound a little bit less certain that it’ s going to happen later this year .  So I ’d like \\r\\nyou—to ask you to talk a little bit more about your conviction about whether these are like —the \\r\\npullback is likely to start this year, wh ere do you stand on that ?  And I also don’ t think I heard \\r\\nyou mentioned that 7 percent unemployment number that you’ ve talked —you talked about back \\r\\nin June .  That was the rate that was —the unemployment rate that was supposed to prevail when \\r\\nthe Fed was done doing this .  Is that no l onger operative?  \\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So ther e is no fixed calendar —schedule, I really have to \\r\\nemphasize that .  If the data confirm our  basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook \\r\\nand we believe that the three- part test that I mentioned is ind eed coming to pass, then we could \\r\\nmove later this year , we could begin later this year .  But even if we do that, the subsequent steps \\r\\nwill be dependent on continued progress in the economy .  So we are tied to the data—we don ’t \\r\\nhave a fixed calendar schedul e—but we do have the same basic framework that I described in \\r\\nJune.   \\r\\nThe criterion for ending the asset purchases  program is a substantial improvement in the \\r\\noutlook for the labor market .  Last time, I gave 7 percent as an indicative number to give you \\r\\nsome sense of, you know, where that might be .  But, as my first answer suggested,  the \\r\\nunemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in  all circumstances , of the  state of the  \\r\\nlabor market overall .  For example, just last month, the decline in  the unemployment rate came \\r\\nabout more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs .  So \\r\\nwhat we will be looking at is the overall labor market situation, including the unemployment September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL \\r\\nPage 11 of 2 7 rate, but including other factors as well .  But , in particular, there is not any magic number that we \\r\\nare shooting for .  We ’re looking for overall improvement in the labor market. \\r\\n</td>\n",

       "209  BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Binya  App elbaum, the New York Times .  To what extent do \\r\\nyou regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted?  Was \\r\\nit a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you stand by your \\r\\nguidance that it will be appropriate ?  Do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down \\r\\nasset purchases by the end of this year?  \\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So to  answer the first part of your question, I think ther e’s \\r\\nno alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible , and that ’s \\r\\nwhat we tried to do.  As of June, we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions , \\r\\nand the C ommittee thought that was the time to begin talking ab out how the eventual wind- down \\r\\nof the program would take place and how it would be tied to the evolution of economic variables .  September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL \\r\\nPage 9 of 2 7 And, in particular, I talked about a proposed strategy that would take about a year for the total \\r\\nwind -down to take place and w hich, in turn, was also fully contingent on the ratification —so to \\r\\nspeak —of our outlook, which included continued improvements in the labor market .  So all of \\r\\nthat was very consistent with what we said when we began the program , that our goal was to \\r\\nachieve a substantial improvement in  the outlook for the labor market , and we needed to \\r\\ncommunicate how that was going to be put into practice .  Failing to communica te that \\r\\ninformation would have  risked creating a large divergence bet ween market expectations, public \\r\\nexpectations, and what the C ommittee intentions were , and that could have led to much more \\r\\nserious problems down the road.  So I think the communication was very important .   \\r\\nThe general framework —to answer the other part of your question, the general \\r\\nframework in which we ’re operating is still the same .  We have a three- part baseline projection , \\r\\nwhich involves increasing growth that ’s picking up over  time as fiscal drag is reduced, \\r\\ncontinuing gains in the labor market , and inflation moving back towards objective .  We are \\r\\nlooking to see —in the coming meetings, we ’ll be looking to see if the data confirm that basic \\r\\noutlook.  If it does, we ’ll take a first step at some point—possibly later this year —and then \\r\\ncontinue so long as  the data are consistent with that continued  progress .  And so that basic \\r\\nstructure is still in place . \\r\\nBut what I want to emphasize is really two things .  First, as I ’ve said, asset purchases are \\r\\nnot on a preset course, they are conditional on the data .  They’ve always been conditional on the \\r\\ndata.  And , secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal \\r\\ntool of monetary policy , it’s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide \\r\\nthe support necessary fo r our economy to recover and to provide jobs for our citizens.

Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Just to follow up on \\r\\nBinya’s question, Mr. Chairman, you said that you could pull  back the purchases possibly later \\r\\nthis year .  You sound a little bit less certain that it’ s going to happen later this year .  So I ’d like \\r\\nyou—to ask you to talk a little bit more about your conviction about whether these are like —the \\r\\npullback is likely to start this year, wh ere do you stand on that ?  And I also don’ t think I heard \\r\\nyou mentioned that 7 percent unemployment number that you’ ve talked —you talked about back \\r\\nin June .  That was the rate that was —the unemployment rate that was supposed to prevail when \\r\\nthe Fed was done doing this .  Is that no l onger operative?  \\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So ther e is no fixed calendar —schedule, I really have to \\r\\nemphasize that .  If the data confirm our  basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook \\r\\nand we believe that the three- part test that I mentioned is ind eed coming to pass, then we could \\r\\nmove later this year , we could begin later this year .  But even if we do that, the subsequent steps \\r\\nwill be dependent on continued progress in the economy .  So we are tied to the data—we don ’t \\r\\nhave a fixed calendar schedul e—but we do have the same basic framework that I described in \\r\\nJune.   \\r\\nThe criterion for ending the asset purchases  program is a substantial improvement in the \\r\\noutlook for the labor market .  Last time, I gave 7 percent as an indicative number to give you \\r\\nsome sense of, you know, where that might be .  But, as my first answer suggested,  the \\r\\nunemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in  all circumstances , of the  state of the  \\r\\nlabor market overall .  For example, just last month, the decline in  the unemployment rate came \\r\\nabout more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs .  So \\r\\nwhat we will be looking at is the overall labor market situation, including the unemployment September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL \\r\\nPage 11 of 2 7 rate, but including other factors as well .  But , in particular, there is not any magic number that we \\r\\nare shooting for .  We ’re looking for overall improvement in the labor market. \\r\\n   \n",

       "      <td>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we’re going to get a pretty weak first-quarter \\r\\nGDP number.  Your own projections  for the year have been downgraded in this meeting.  How—\\r\\nfirst of all, what do you see as the causes of the weak growth to start the year, even with \\r\\nmonetary easing, even with payr oll tax cuts?  And what’s behi nd this weaker forecast for 2011 \\r\\nGDP?  \\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You’re correct.  We haven’t seen the GDP number yet.  But \\r\\nwe, like most private-sector forecasters, are e xpecting a relatively weak  number for the first \\r\\nquarter, maybe something a little und er 2 percent.  Most of the f actors that account for the slower \\r\\ngrowth in the first quarter appear to us to be tr ansitory.  They include things like, for example, \\r\\nlower defense spending than was anticipated, wh ich will presumably be made up in a later \\r\\nquarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick \\r\\nup again; and other factors like w eather and so on.  Now, there are some factors there that may \\r\\nhave a longer-term implication.  For example, c onstruction, both residential and nonresidential, \\r\\nwas very weak in the first quarter, and that ma y have some implications going forward.  So I \\r\\nwould say that, roughly, that most of the sl owdown in the first quarter is viewed by the \\r\\nCommittee as being transitory.  Th at being said, we’ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL \\r\\n7 of 26 \\r\\n into account factors like—like w eaker construction and possibly ju st a bit less momentum in the \\r\\neconomy.</td>\n",

       "1  UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow we’re going to get a pretty weak first-quarter \\r\\nGDP number.  Your own projections  for the year have been downgraded in this meeting.  How—\\r\\nfirst of all, what do you see as the causes of the weak growth to start the year, even with \\r\\nmonetary easing, even with payr oll tax cuts?  And what’s behi nd this weaker forecast for 2011 \\r\\nGDP?  \\r\\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You’re correct.  We haven’t seen the GDP number yet.  But \\r\\nwe, like most private-sector forecasters, are e xpecting a relatively weak  number for the first \\r\\nquarter, maybe something a little und er 2 percent.  Most of the f actors that account for the slower \\r\\ngrowth in the first quarter appear to us to be tr ansitory.  They include things like, for example, \\r\\nlower defense spending than was anticipated, wh ich will presumably be made up in a later \\r\\nquarter; weaker exports—and given the growth in the global economy, we expect to see that pick \\r\\nup again; and other factors like w eather and so on.  Now, there are some factors there that may \\r\\nhave a longer-term implication.  For example, c onstruction, both residential and nonresidential, \\r\\nwas very weak in the first quarter, and that ma y have some implications going forward.  So I \\r\\nwould say that, roughly, that most of the sl owdown in the first quarter is viewed by the \\r\\nCommittee as being transitory.  Th at being said, we’ve taken our forecast down just a bit, taking April 27, 2011 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference FINAL \\r\\n7 of 26 \\r\\n into account factors like—like w eaker construction and possibly ju st a bit less momentum in the \\r\\neconomy.   \n",

my colleagues and i remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing  and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal  price stabilit yis the responsibility of the federal reserve  without price stability  the economy does n t work for anyone  in particular  without price stability  we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all  since early last year  the fomc has significantly tighten ed the stance of monetary policy   we have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points and have continued to reduc e our securities holdings at a brisk pace   we have covered a lot of ground  and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening   today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings  looking ahead  nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time  i will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments  the u s  economy slo wed significantly last yea r  and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace   although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year  a ctivity in the housing sector remains weak   large ly reflecting highe r mortgage rates  higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment   committee participants generally expect subdued june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 2of 5 growth to continue  in our summary of economic projections  the median projection has real gdp growth at 1 0 percent this year and 1 1 percent next year  well below the median estimate of the longer  run normal growth rate  the labor market remain s very tight  over the past three months  payroll job gains averaged a robust 283 thousand jobs per month   the unemployment rate moved up but remained low in may  at 3  7 percent   there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance  the labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months   particularly for individuals aged 25to 54 years   nominal w age growth has shown signs of easing   and job vacancies have declined so far this year   while the jobs  to workers gap has declined   labor demand still substantially exceeds the suppl yof available workers  fomc participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time  easing upward pressures on inflation   the median unemployment rate projection in the sep rises to 4 1 percent at the end of this year and 4 5 percent at the end of next yea r  inflation remains well above our longer  run 2 percent goal  over the 12 months ending in april   total pce prices rose 4 4 percent   excluding the volatile food and energy categories  core pce prices rose 4 7 percent   in may  the 12  month change in the consumer price index came in at 4 0 percent  and the change in the core cpi was 5 3 percent  inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year   nonetheless  inflation pressures continue to run high and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go   the median projection in the sep for total pce inflation is 3 2 percent this year  2 5 percent next year  and 2 1 percent in 2025  core pce inflation  which excludes volatile food and energy prices  is projected to run higher than total inflation  and the median projection has been revised up to 3 9 percent this year  despite elevated inflation  longer  term inflation expectations appear to remain june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 3of 5 well anchored   as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households  businesses  and forecasters  a s well as measures from financial markets   the fed s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power   especially for those least able to mee t the higher costs of essentials like food  housing  and transportation  we are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate  and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective   as i not ed earlier  s ince early last year   we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points  we have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest   rate sensitive sectors of the economy  especially housing and investment   it will take time  however  for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized  especially on inflation  the economy is fac ing headwinds from tighte r credit conditions for households and businesses   which are likely to weigh on economic activit y  hiring  and inflation  the extent of these effects remains uncertain   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening  the committee decided at today s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 1 4 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings   as i noted earlier  nearly all committee participants expe ct that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year   but at this meeting   considering how far and how fast we have moved  we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy   in june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 4of 5 determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time  the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy  the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation  and economic and financial developments  in our sep  participant s wrote down their individual assessment sof an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward  if the economy evolves as projected  the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5 6 percent at the end of this year  4 6 percent at the end of 2024  and 3 4 percent at the end of 2025  for the end of this year  the median projection is 1 2 percentage point higher than in our march projections  i hasten to add   as always  that these projections are not a committee decision or p lan  if the economy does not evolve as projected  the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals  we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting  based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks   we remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep ing longer  term inflation expectations well anchored  reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below  trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions  restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run  to conclude  we u nderstand that our actions affect communities  families  and businesses across the country  everything we do at the fed is in service to our public mission  we will do june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 5of 5 everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goal s  thank you  i look forward to your questions</td>\n",

stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks  and  secondly  do you still have a bias to tighten rates  is that what the statement is saying  chair powell  so i guess i would  i guess i would say it this way  there were three large banks  really  from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we   that we saw in early march  the severe period of stress  those have now all been resolved  and all the depositors have been protected  i think that the resolution and sale of   of first republic kind of draws a line under that period of  is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of   of severe stress  okay  i also think we are very focused on what  s happening with credit availability  particularly  you know  with what you saw in the  in the beige book  and you will see in the sloos   is  is small and medium medium  sized  small and medium  sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards  build liquidity  what  s going to be the macroeconomic effect of that  more broadly  we   we will continue to very care fully monitor what  s going on in the banking system  and we  ll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way  going forward  michelle smith  okay  greg    \n",

                                                greg robb  thank you  fed chairman  greg robb from marketwatch  i just wondered if you  ve done any reflection on  on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last since you  ve been fed chairman  i think i  ve heard you say a couple of times that you defer red to the vice c hair for s upervision  do you think that was the right way to go about this  and   yeah  comments on that  thank you  chair powell  sure  so let me say  first of all  i  ve been chair of the board for five plus years now  and i fully recognize that we made mistakes  i think we ve learned some may 3  2023 chair powell  s press conference final page 23of 25 new things as well  and we need to do better  and   as i mentioned  i thought the report was unflinching and appropriately so  i welcome it  and i agree with and will support those recommendations  and i do feel that i  m personally accountable to do what i can to foster measures that will address the problems  so  on  on the v ice c hair for s upervision  you know  the place to start is   is the statutory role  which is quite unusual  the vice chair  it says  shall deploy policy recommendations   develop policy recommendations for the board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution       companies         and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms   so this is congress establishing a four  year term for someone else on the board not   not the c hair as v ice c hair for supervision who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the board of governors  congress wanted that person to be  to have political accountability for developing that agenda  so the way it works  the way it has worked in practice for meis   i ve had a good working relationship  i give my  my counsel  my input privately  and that  s i offer that  and i have good conversations  and i try to contribute constructively  i respect the authority that congress has deferred on that person  including working with  with vice chair barr and   and his predecessor  and i think that s the way it  s supposed to work  and that  s appropriate  i  i believe that  s what the law requires  and  you know  but   but it isn  t i wouldn  t say it  sa matter of complete deference  it s more   i have a  i have a role in   in presenting my views and discussing having an intelligent discussion about what  s going on and why  and  you know  that  s  that  smy input  but  ultimately   that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the board of governors and really  in supervision  has sole authority over supervision  greg robb  just wondered if you have any regrets  or was there anything that  you know  decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what  s happened  may 3  2023 chair powell  s press conference final page 24of 25 chair powell  i ve had a few   sure  i mean  you know  who doesn  t look back and think that you could have done things differently  but  honestly  you don  t you don  t get to do that  again  my focus is on what  control the controllable  as one of my great mentors used to always say   c ontrol the controllable   what we control now is   make a fair assessment  learn the right lessons  figure out what the fixes are  and implement them  and   and i think that   that vice chair barr  s report is an excellent first step in that  but we  ve got to follow through    \n",

meeting come up at all  and how seriously was that considered  i m curious if you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again or what those discussions entailed  chair powell  so support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board  i would say there are a number of people  and  you know  you  ll see this in the minutes  i don  t want to try to do the head count in real time  but people did talk about pausing  but not so much at this meeting  you know  that we  re i mean  there  sa sense that we  re  we re that  you know  we  re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning  that  you know  as i mentioned  if you if you add up all the tightening that  s going on through various channels  it  s we   we feel like we  you know  we  re getting close or   or maybe even there  but that  again  that  s going to be an ongoing assessment  and   and we  re going to be looking at those factors that we listed and  to determine whether there  s  there  s more to do  megan cas sella  i m curious  too  how to interpret that and  and the changes to the statement  is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting  or would a strong jobs report or inflation print be enough to push the fedto tighten again  may 3  2023 chair powell  s press conference final page 25of 25 chair powell  i don  t want to  i couldn  t i couldn  t really say  i just think we re i think we  look   i think we  ve moved a long way fairly quickly  and i think we can afford to look at the data and  and make a careful assessment  michelle smith  and we  llgoto nancy for the last question    \n",

marshall  genzer with marketplace  you mentioned a few times about the lessons you  ve learned from the banking crisis  that you would learn the right lessons  what are those lessons  chair powell  well  i just would start with something that  s changed  really  which is this  the run on silicon valley bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history  and that now needs to be reflected in some  in some way in regulation and in supervision  it  we know  now that we know it  s possible  i think we didn  t no one thought that was possible  no one  i m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so quite so quickly  so i think that  you know  that will play through  i  i  you know  it will be up to vice chair barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that  but i think  i think that s one thing  i  i guess i would just say that   then  you know  tha twe re going to  obviously  we  re going to revisit  this    it s pretty clear we need  to me   anyways  clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size  and i  m  i m thinking that we  reon the  on track to do that as w ell  nancy marshall  genzer  can you be any more specific on stress testing or looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy  chair powell  yeah  that  s see  that  s  that  s what vice chair barr  s role really is  and he  ll take the lead on that  thank you    \n",
       "1275  june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 1of 5 transcript of ch air powell  s press conference opening statement june 14   202 3 chair powell  good afternoon   my colleagues and i remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing  and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal  price stabilit yis the responsibility of the federal reserve  without price stability  the economy does n t work for anyone  in particular  without price stability  we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all  since early last year  the fomc has significantly tighten ed the stance of monetary policy   we have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points and have continued to reduc e our securities holdings at a brisk pace   we have covered a lot of ground  and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening   today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings  looking ahead  nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time  i will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments  the u s  economy slo wed significantly last yea r  and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace   although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year  a ctivity in the housing sector remains weak   large ly reflecting highe r mortgage rates  higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment   committee participants generally expect subdued june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 2of 5 growth to continue  in our summary of economic projections  the median projection has real gdp growth at 1 0 percent this year and 1 1 percent next year  well below the median estimate of the longer  run normal growth rate  the labor market remain s very tight  over the past three months  payroll job gains averaged a robust 283 thousand jobs per month   the unemployment rate moved up but remained low in may  at 3  7 percent   there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance  the labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months   particularly for individuals aged 25to 54 years   nominal w age growth has shown signs of easing   and job vacancies have declined so far this year   while the jobs  to workers gap has declined   labor demand still substantially exceeds the suppl yof available workers  fomc participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time  easing upward pressures on inflation   the median unemployment rate projection in the sep rises to 4 1 percent at the end of this year and 4 5 percent at the end of next yea r  inflation remains well above our longer  run 2 percent goal  over the 12 months ending in april   total pce prices rose 4 4 percent   excluding the volatile food and energy categories  core pce prices rose 4 7 percent   in may  the 12  month change in the consumer price index came in at 4 0 percent  and the change in the core cpi was 5 3 percent  inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year   nonetheless  inflation pressures continue to run high and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go   the median projection in the sep for total pce inflation is 3 2 percent this year  2 5 percent next year  and 2 1 percent in 2025  core pce inflation  which excludes volatile food and energy prices  is projected to run higher than total inflation  and the median projection has been revised up to 3 9 percent this year  despite elevated inflation  longer  term inflation expectations appear to remain june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 3of 5 well anchored   as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households  businesses  and forecasters  a s well as measures from financial markets   the fed s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power   especially for those least able to mee t the higher costs of essentials like food  housing  and transportation  we are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate  and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective   as i not ed earlier  s ince early last year   we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points  we have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest   rate sensitive sectors of the economy  especially housing and investment   it will take time  however  for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized  especially on inflation  the economy is fac ing headwinds from tighte r credit conditions for households and businesses   which are likely to weigh on economic activit y  hiring  and inflation  the extent of these effects remains uncertain   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening  the committee decided at today s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 1 4 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings   as i noted earlier  nearly all committee participants expe ct that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year   but at this meeting   considering how far and how fast we have moved  we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy   in june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 4of 5 determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time  the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy  the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation  and economic and financial developments  in our sep  participant s wrote down their individual assessment sof an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward  if the economy evolves as projected  the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5 6 percent at the end of this year  4 6 percent at the end of 2024  and 3 4 percent at the end of 2025  for the end of this year  the median projection is 1 2 percentage point higher than in our march projections  i hasten to add   as always  that these projections are not a committee decision or p lan  if the economy does not evolve as projected  the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals  we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting  based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks   we remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep ing longer  term inflation expectations well anchored  reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below  trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions  restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run  to conclude  we u nderstand that our actions affect communities  families  and businesses across the country  everything we do at the fed is in service to our public mission  we will do june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 5of 5 everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goal s  thank you  i look forward to your questions    \n",

my colleagues and i remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing  and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal  price stabilit yis the responsibility of the federal reserve  without price stability  the economy does n t work for anyone  in particular  without price stability  we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all  since early last year  the fomc has significantly tighten ed the stance of monetary policy   we have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points and have continued to reduc e our securities holdings at a brisk pace   we have covered a lot of ground  and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening   today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings  looking ahead  nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time  i will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments  the u s  economy slo wed significantly last yea r  and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace   although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year  a ctivity in the housing sector remains weak   large ly reflecting highe r mortgage rates  higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment   committee participants generally expect subdued june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 2of 5 growth to continue  in our summary of economic projections  the median projection has real gdp growth at 1 0 percent this year and 1 1 percent next year  well below the median estimate of the longer  run normal growth rate  the labor market remain s very tight  over the past three months  payroll job gains averaged a robust 283 thousand jobs per month   the unemployment rate moved up but remained low in may  at 3  7 percent   there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance  the labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months   particularly for individuals aged 25to 54 years   nominal w age growth has shown signs of easing   and job vacancies have declined so far this year   while the jobs  to workers gap has declined   labor demand still substantially exceeds the suppl yof available workers  fomc participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time  easing upward pressures on inflation   the median unemployment rate projection in the sep rises to 4 1 percent at the end of this year and 4 5 percent at the end of next yea r  inflation remains well above our longer  run 2 percent goal  over the 12 months ending in april   total pce prices rose 4 4 percent   excluding the volatile food and energy categories  core pce prices rose 4 7 percent   in may  the 12  month change in the consumer price index came in at 4 0 percent  and the change in the core cpi was 5 3 percent  inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year   nonetheless  inflation pressures continue to run high and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go   the median projection in the sep for total pce inflation is 3 2 percent this year  2 5 percent next year  and 2 1 percent in 2025  core pce inflation  which excludes volatile food and energy prices  is projected to run higher than total inflation  and the median projection has been revised up to 3 9 percent this year  despite elevated inflation  longer  term inflation expectations appear to remain june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 3of 5 well anchored   as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households  businesses  and forecasters  a s well as measures from financial markets   the fed s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power   especially for those least able to mee t the higher costs of essentials like food  housing  and transportation  we are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate  and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective   as i not ed earlier  s ince early last year   we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points  we have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest   rate sensitive sectors of the economy  especially housing and investment   it will take time  however  for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized  especially on inflation  the economy is fac ing headwinds from tighte r credit conditions for households and businesses   which are likely to weigh on economic activit y  hiring  and inflation  the extent of these effects remains uncertain   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening  the committee decided at today s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 1 4 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings   as i noted earlier  nearly all committee participants expe ct that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year   but at this meeting   considering how far and how fast we have moved  we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy   in june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 4of 5 determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time  the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy  the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation  and economic and financial developments  in our sep  participant s wrote down their individual assessment sof an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward  if the economy evolves as projected  the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5 6 percent at the end of this year  4 6 percent at the end of 2024  and 3 4 percent at the end of 2025  for the end of this year  the median projection is 1 2 percentage point higher than in our march projections  i hasten to add   as always  that these projections are not a committee decision or p lan  if the economy does not evolve as projected  the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals  we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting  based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks   we remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep ing longer  term inflation expectations well anchored  reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below  trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions  restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run  to conclude  we u nderstand that our actions affect communities  families  and businesses across the country  everything we do at the fed is in service to our public mission  we will do june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 5of 5 everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goal s  thank you  i look forward to your questions</td>\n",

stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks  and  secondly  do you still have a bias to tighten rates  is that what the statement is saying  chair powell  so i guess i would  i guess i would say it this way  there were three large banks  really  from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we   that we saw in early march  the severe period of stress  those have now all been resolved  and all the depositors have been protected  i think that the resolution and sale of   of first republic kind of draws a line under that period of  is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of   of severe stress  okay  i also think we are very focused on what  s happening with credit availability  particularly  you know  with what you saw in the  in the beige book  and you will see in the sloos   is  is small and medium medium  sized  small and medium  sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards  build liquidity  what  s going to be the macroeconomic effect of that  more broadly  we   we will continue to very care fully monitor what  s going on in the banking system  and we  ll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way  going forward  michelle smith  okay  greg    \n",

                                                greg robb  thank you  fed chairman  greg robb from marketwatch  i just wondered if you  ve done any reflection on  on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last since you  ve been fed chairman  i think i  ve heard you say a couple of times that you defer red to the vice c hair for s upervision  do you think that was the right way to go about this  and   yeah  comments on that  thank you  chair powell  sure  so let me say  first of all  i  ve been chair of the board for five plus years now  and i fully recognize that we made mistakes  i think we ve learned some may 3  2023 chair powell  s press conference final page 23of 25 new things as well  and we need to do better  and   as i mentioned  i thought the report was unflinching and appropriately so  i welcome it  and i agree with and will support those recommendations  and i do feel that i  m personally accountable to do what i can to foster measures that will address the problems  so  on  on the v ice c hair for s upervision  you know  the place to start is   is the statutory role  which is quite unusual  the vice chair  it says  shall deploy policy recommendations   develop policy recommendations for the board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution       companies         and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms   so this is congress establishing a four  year term for someone else on the board not   not the c hair as v ice c hair for supervision who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the board of governors  congress wanted that person to be  to have political accountability for developing that agenda  so the way it works  the way it has worked in practice for meis   i ve had a good working relationship  i give my  my counsel  my input privately  and that  s i offer that  and i have good conversations  and i try to contribute constructively  i respect the authority that congress has deferred on that person  including working with  with vice chair barr and   and his predecessor  and i think that s the way it  s supposed to work  and that  s appropriate  i  i believe that  s what the law requires  and  you know  but   but it isn  t i wouldn  t say it  sa matter of complete deference  it s more   i have a  i have a role in   in presenting my views and discussing having an intelligent discussion about what  s going on and why  and  you know  that  s  that  smy input  but  ultimately   that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the board of governors and really  in supervision  has sole authority over supervision  greg robb  just wondered if you have any regrets  or was there anything that  you know  decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what  s happened  may 3  2023 chair powell  s press conference final page 24of 25 chair powell  i ve had a few   sure  i mean  you know  who doesn  t look back and think that you could have done things differently  but  honestly  you don  t you don  t get to do that  again  my focus is on what  control the controllable  as one of my great mentors used to always say   c ontrol the controllable   what we control now is   make a fair assessment  learn the right lessons  figure out what the fixes are  and implement them  and   and i think that   that vice chair barr  s report is an excellent first step in that  but we  ve got to follow through    \n",

meeting come up at all  and how seriously was that considered  i m curious if you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again or what those discussions entailed  chair powell  so support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board  i would say there are a number of people  and  you know  you  ll see this in the minutes  i don  t want to try to do the head count in real time  but people did talk about pausing  but not so much at this meeting  you know  that we  re i mean  there  sa sense that we  re  we re that  you know  we  re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning  that  you know  as i mentioned  if you if you add up all the tightening that  s going on through various channels  it  s we   we feel like we  you know  we  re getting close or   or maybe even there  but that  again  that  s going to be an ongoing assessment  and   and we  re going to be looking at those factors that we listed and  to determine whether there  s  there  s more to do  megan cas sella  i m curious  too  how to interpret that and  and the changes to the statement  is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting  or would a strong jobs report or inflation print be enough to push the fedto tighten again  may 3  2023 chair powell  s press conference final page 25of 25 chair powell  i don  t want to  i couldn  t i couldn  t really say  i just think we re i think we  look   i think we  ve moved a long way fairly quickly  and i think we can afford to look at the data and  and make a careful assessment  michelle smith  and we  llgoto nancy for the last question    \n",

marshall  genzer with marketplace  you mentioned a few times about the lessons you  ve learned from the banking crisis  that you would learn the right lessons  what are those lessons  chair powell  well  i just would start with something that  s changed  really  which is this  the run on silicon valley bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history  and that now needs to be reflected in some  in some way in regulation and in supervision  it  we know  now that we know it  s possible  i think we didn  t no one thought that was possible  no one  i m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so quite so quickly  so i think that  you know  that will play through  i  i  you know  it will be up to vice chair barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that  but i think  i think that s one thing  i  i guess i would just say that   then  you know  tha twe re going to  obviously  we  re going to revisit  this    it s pretty clear we need  to me   anyways  clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size  and i  m  i m thinking that we  reon the  on track to do that as w ell  nancy marshall  genzer  can you be any more specific on stress testing or looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy  chair powell  yeah  that  s see  that  s  that  s what vice chair barr  s role really is  and he  ll take the lead on that  thank you    \n",
       "1275  june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 1of 5 transcript of ch air powell  s press conference opening statement june 14   202 3 chair powell  good afternoon   my colleagues and i remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing  and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal  price stabilit yis the responsibility of the federal reserve  without price stability  the economy does n t work for anyone  in particular  without price stability  we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all  since early last year  the fomc has significantly tighten ed the stance of monetary policy   we have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points and have continued to reduc e our securities holdings at a brisk pace   we have covered a lot of ground  and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening   today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings  looking ahead  nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time  i will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments  the u s  economy slo wed significantly last yea r  and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace   although growth in consumer spending has picked up this year  a ctivity in the housing sector remains weak   large ly reflecting highe r mortgage rates  higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment   committee participants generally expect subdued june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 2of 5 growth to continue  in our summary of economic projections  the median projection has real gdp growth at 1 0 percent this year and 1 1 percent next year  well below the median estimate of the longer  run normal growth rate  the labor market remain s very tight  over the past three months  payroll job gains averaged a robust 283 thousand jobs per month   the unemployment rate moved up but remained low in may  at 3  7 percent   there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance  the labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months   particularly for individuals aged 25to 54 years   nominal w age growth has shown signs of easing   and job vacancies have declined so far this year   while the jobs  to workers gap has declined   labor demand still substantially exceeds the suppl yof available workers  fomc participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time  easing upward pressures on inflation   the median unemployment rate projection in the sep rises to 4 1 percent at the end of this year and 4 5 percent at the end of next yea r  inflation remains well above our longer  run 2 percent goal  over the 12 months ending in april   total pce prices rose 4 4 percent   excluding the volatile food and energy categories  core pce prices rose 4 7 percent   in may  the 12  month change in the consumer price index came in at 4 0 percent  and the change in the core cpi was 5 3 percent  inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year   nonetheless  inflation pressures continue to run high and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go   the median projection in the sep for total pce inflation is 3 2 percent this year  2 5 percent next year  and 2 1 percent in 2025  core pce inflation  which excludes volatile food and energy prices  is projected to run higher than total inflation  and the median projection has been revised up to 3 9 percent this year  despite elevated inflation  longer  term inflation expectations appear to remain june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 3of 5 well anchored   as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households  businesses  and forecasters  a s well as measures from financial markets   the fed s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the american people  my colleagues and i are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power   especially for those least able to mee t the higher costs of essentials like food  housing  and transportation  we are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate  and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective   as i not ed earlier  s ince early last year   we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points  we have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest   rate sensitive sectors of the economy  especially housing and investment   it will take time  however  for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized  especially on inflation  the economy is fac ing headwinds from tighte r credit conditions for households and businesses   which are likely to weigh on economic activit y  hiring  and inflation  the extent of these effects remains uncertain   in light of how far we have come in tightening policy   the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy  and potential headwinds from credit tightening  the committee decided at today s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 1 4 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings   as i noted earlier  nearly all committee participants expe ct that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year   but at this meeting   considering how far and how fast we have moved  we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy   in june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 4of 5 determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time  the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy  the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation  and economic and financial developments  in our sep  participant s wrote down their individual assessment sof an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward  if the economy evolves as projected  the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5 6 percent at the end of this year  4 6 percent at the end of 2024  and 3 4 percent at the end of 2025  for the end of this year  the median projection is 1 2 percentage point higher than in our march projections  i hasten to add   as always  that these projections are not a committee decision or p lan  if the economy does not evolve as projected  the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals  we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting  based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks   we remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep ing longer  term inflation expectations well anchored  reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below  trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions  restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run  to conclude  we u nderstand that our actions affect communities  families  and businesses across the country  everything we do at the fed is in service to our public mission  we will do june 14  2023 chair powell  s press conference preliminary page 5of 5 everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goal s  thank you  i look forward to your questions    \n",

       "      <td>greg robb   greg robb  marketwatch   mr   chairman  thank you  you haven  t had a very good time in all the republican presidential debates   and i was wondering if i could have your comment on what you  ve heard   and some of the analysts i talked to said that one of the reasons for this hostility  perhaps   is that a lot of the re publican primary voters are on fixed incomes and have an inability to invest and make money with their funds   so could you talk to them as well  and one more thing  if republicans take back the white house in november and ask you to resign  would you  chairman bernanke   so i  m not going to get involved in political rhet oric  i m just going to stay completely away from that   i have a job to do  a ndas long as i  m here  i will do everything i can to help the federal reserve achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment  t hat smy answer to the last part as well   i m not going to be thinking about hypothetical situations in the future   in the case of savers  you know  we think about all these issues   and we certainly recognize that the low interest rates that we  re using to try to stimulate investment and expansion of the economy also impose a cost on savers who have a lower return   and we do hear about that   obviously   and we do think about that   i guess the response i would make is that the savers in our economy are dependent on a healthy economy in order to get adequate returns   in particular  people own stocks and corporate bonds and ot her securities as well as   say  t reasury securities   and if our economy is in really bad shape  then january 25  2012 chairman bernanke s press conference final 14of 29 they are not going to get good returns on those investments   so i think what we need to do  as is often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation  then low interest rates are needed to help re store the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase growth and that   in turn  will lead ultimately to higher return s across all assets for savers and investors   so that  s i think that  s how we would explain it   but again  you know  we recognize that during periods like this  savers are getting a lower return   one reason why it  s extremely important for usto maintain price stability  of course  is that at least that minimizes any loss es due to inflation that savers might suffer</td>\n",

       "      <td>scott spoerry   scott spoerry with cnnmoney  sir   i wante dto ask you about the labor force participation rate   it sat the lowest level since the early   80s  can you talk about why people are dropping out of the job market  whether it  sa permanent structural problem   and what convinces you that things may ch ange  if i could just a pop a second question to follow up on steve and the bonds  your colleague sheila bair wrote this week that her  about her concern april 25  2012 chairman bernanke s press conference final 20of 23 over being in a bond bubble   she said you should declare victory  and you should do something about puncturing that bubble before it gets too much out of control   can you respond to that too  chairman bernanke   on declaring victory  i think it  sa little premature to declare victory   i think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our e conomy   as for the bond bubble  interest rates are low for a lot of reasons   they include monetary policy   of course   but they also include a weak economy  low inflation expectations   and safe  haven demands for u s  t reasuries   so  of course   interest rates will rise at some point  we hope that they do because that would be an indication that the economy is recovering and strengthening   and i think it  s important for holders of long  term securities to manage their risks and pay attention to that   but all that being said  i think   again   that there are both good reasons to continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low   the f irst part of your question was   scott spoerry  about the   chairman bernanke   oh  participatio n  labor participation  yes   actually   we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting be cause it is an important issue   trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural  how much is cyclical   and so on  there is   in fact   a downw ard trend in labor participation in the united states   it comes from   first   the fact that we  reno longer getting increased participation from women  f emale participation has leveled out   and   secondly   because  as the society ages   and also for other reasons  male participation has been declining over time   so there is a downward trend that we have to take into account   the participants at the meeting  at least some of them   suggested  though  that a good bit of the decline in participation that we  ve seen in the last few years does represent cyclical april 25  2012 chairman bernanke s press conference final 21of 23 factors   much of it is young people   for example  who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely   but  given the weak job market  they are going to school or doing something else rather than working   so one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens  as the labor market strengthens  many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for wor k  which i think would be a good thing   but we  ll just have to see   but i do think  i think i would agree with the argument that a significant part of the decline over and above the downward trend in the participation rate is reflecting cyclical factors a nd should reverse when the economy gets stronger</td>\n",

       "96   scott spoerry   scott spoerry with cnnmoney  sir   i wante dto ask you about the labor force participation rate   it sat the lowest level since the early   80s  can you talk about why people are dropping out of the job market  whether it  sa permanent structural problem   and what convinces you that things may ch ange  if i could just a pop a second question to follow up on steve and the bonds  your colleague sheila bair wrote this week that her  about her concern april 25  2012 chairman bernanke s press conference final 20of 23 over being in a bond bubble   she said you should declare victory  and you should do something about puncturing that bubble before it gets too much out of control   can you respond to that too  chairman bernanke   on declaring victory  i think it  sa little premature to declare victory   i think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our e conomy   as for the bond bubble  interest rates are low for a lot of reasons   they include monetary policy   of course   but they also include a weak economy  low inflation expectations   and safe  haven demands for u s  t reasuries   so  of course   interest rates will rise at some point  we hope that they do because that would be an indication that the economy is recovering and strengthening   and i think it  s important for holders of long  term securities to manage their risks and pay attention to that   but all that being said  i think   again   that there are both good reasons to continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low   the f irst part of your question was   scott spoerry  about the   chairman bernanke   oh  participatio n  labor participation  yes   actually   we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting be cause it is an important issue   trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural  how much is cyclical   and so on  there is   in fact   a downw ard trend in labor participation in the united states   it comes from   first   the fact that we  reno longer getting increased participation from women  f emale participation has leveled out   and   secondly   because  as the society ages   and also for other reasons  male participation has been declining over time   so there is a downward trend that we have to take into account   the participants at the meeting  at least some of them   suggested  though  that a good bit of the decline in participation that we  ve seen in the last few years does represent cyclical april 25  2012 chairman bernanke s press conference final 21of 23 factors   much of it is young people   for example  who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely   but  given the weak job market  they are going to school or doing something else rather than working   so one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens  as the labor market strengthens  many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for wor k  which i think would be a good thing   but we  ll just have to see   but i do think  i think i would agree with the argument that a significant part of the decline over and above the downward trend in the participation rate is reflecting cyclical factors a nd should reverse when the economy gets stronger     \n",
