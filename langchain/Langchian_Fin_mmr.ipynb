The war and related events are creating  additional upward pressure on \\ninflation and are weighing on global economic activity.  The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.   \\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate \\nof 2 percent over the longer run.  I n support of these goals, the Committee decided to \\nraise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3-1/4 percent and anticipates \\nthat ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.  In addition, the Committee will continue reducing it s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt \\nand agency mortgage -backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the \\nSize of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May .  The Committee \\nis strongly committed to returning infla tion to its 2 percent objective.    \\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will \\ncontinue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.
